# PUPSON'S BAY website


As a personal and fun project, I implemented an 18 page e-commerce website (puppy clothing) from scratch.

Stack and technologies:

* MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJs, NodeJs)
* Firebase
* React-redux
* Semantic-UI
* Nodemailer
* Paypal API
* Google Maps API
* JWT
* Axios

The website's UI can be seen in the Pupson's bay screenshot folder.
Here is a sample screenshot of the site:

I might add a tutorial on how to get started on the project soon!
